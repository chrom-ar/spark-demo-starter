# Spark A1 Demo - Blockchain Development Base Project

This is a bare project template for vibe coding sessions exploring [Spark A1](https://chrom.ar/spark-a1) and blockchain development.

## About Spark A1

Spark A1 is Chroma's intelligent blockchain development assistant that provides real-time documentation, best practices, and code examples for Web3 development.

## Getting Started

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your API keys:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Configure your environment variables:
   - `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`: Your Etherscan API key for contract verification
   - `PRIVATE_KEY`: Your wallet private key for deployments
   - `RPC_URL`: Your blockchain RPC endpoint

## Project Structure

This is an intentionally minimal setup ready for:
- Smart contract development
- DeFi protocol integration
- NFT projects
- Web3 application development
- Blockchain experimentation

## Cursor Integration

This project includes a `.cursor/rules` configuration that automatically uses the chroma-spark MCP for all blockchain and Web3 queries, ensuring you always get the most up-to-date documentation and best practices.

## Ready to Build

Start your vibe coding session and explore blockchain development with Spark A1's intelligent assistance!
